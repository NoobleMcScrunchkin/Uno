# Uno
Online working version of Uno with multiple lobbies, customizable game rules and password protected lobbies. Plays in real time using the Colyseus framework. Has two parts (which are currently plublished in the same folder, oops). One part is the web server which hosts the html documents and images, the other part being the game server which is the backend of the application.
